Ello there! I'm Wize (aka LiterallyWize).

I've got over 6 years of experience with using Luau, but I no longer focus on my Roblox projects.
I'm now primarily working with C++ and also dabbling in JavaScript and Python!

Quality is my priority, and Iâ€™m all about pushing my limits and perfecting my code.
