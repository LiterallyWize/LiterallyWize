Ello there! I'm Wize (aka LiterallyWize).

With 6+ years in Luau, I've shifted my focus away from my Roblox projects, and am now primarily working with C++! I also like to dabble into other languages, particularly Java / JavaScript and Python.

I’m VERY passionate about graphics programming and interested in stuff like OpenGL, Vulkan, physics systems, custom file formats, and such!
Often times I try to reinvent the wheel just for the thrill of it!

I prioritize quality over all else, and I’m all about pushing my limits, perfecting my code, and coffee!
