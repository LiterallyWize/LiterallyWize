## Ello there! I'm Wize (aka LiterallyWize).

With 6+ years of experience in Luau, I've shifted my focus away from my Roblox projects, and am now primarily working with C++! I also like to dabble into other languages, particularly Java / JavaScript and Python.

_"Graphics"_ is my favourite word, and I'm passionate about stuff like creating game engines, using OpenGL and Vulkan, developing physics systems, voxel graphics, creating new file formats, and such! 
Often I try to reinvent the wheel just for the thrill of it!

I prioritize quality over all else, and I’m all about pushing my limits, perfecting my code, and of course, coffee.

#### (I also enjoy composing and producing music! You can find me on my Spotify [here.](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3b3SM98HFVmOcE46DSgGwQ?si=012ddd67f52d4c43))
