## Ello there! I'm Wize (aka LiterallyWize).

I'm interested in stuff like video game graphics, data compression, game engines, and such.
<br>Often I like to reinvent the wheel for the thrill of it!

## Programming Experience (as of March 11, 2025):

**Luau:**  7 years. I'm very experienced and confident in using this language.

**C++:**  7 months. I'm very interested in this language, and am reasonably experienced in using it.

**Rust:**  5 months. I plan on using this language more in the future, and am partially experienced in using it.

**Python:**  5 months. I'm somewhat experienced in using this language, though not very interested.

###### *(Please note that these state roughly the time since my FIRST usage of a language, not active usage.)*
