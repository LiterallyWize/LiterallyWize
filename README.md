## Ello there! I'm Wize (aka LiterallyWize).

I'm interested in stuff like creating game engines, creating games with 'em, developing physics / graphics systems, creating file formats, and such.
Often I try to reinvent the wheel just for the thrill of it!

## Programming Experience (as of October 22, 2024):

**C++:**  ~3 months. I'm very, very interested in this language, and have a good grasp of it.

**Rust:**  Under a month. I'm very interested in this language, and excited to learn it.

**Luau:**  6+ years. I'm very experienced and confident in using this language.

**Python:**  Under a month. I'm partly interested, and planning on using this language more.

**GDScript:**  6+ months. I'm fairly knowledgeable in this language, though not very interested.
