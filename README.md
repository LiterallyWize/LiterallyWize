## Ello there! I'm Wize (aka LiterallyWize). 

I'm interested in stuff like creating game engines, creating games with 'em, developing physics / graphics systems, creating file formats, and such. 
Often I try to reinvent the wheel just for the thrill of it! 

## Programming Experience (as of October 6th, 2024): 

**C++:**  ~2 months. I'm very, very interested in this language, and have a good grasp of it. 

**Rust:**  Beginning to learn as of today. I'm very interested in this language, and excited to learn it. 

**Luau:**  6+ years. I'm very experienced and confident in using this language. 

**Python:**  Under a month. I'm partly interested, and planning on using this language more. 

**GDScript:**  6+ months. I'm fairly knowledgeable in this language, though not very interested.
